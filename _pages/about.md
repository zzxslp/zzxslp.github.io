Hi there! I am a reseach scientist at Salesforce AI Research, directed by [Silvio Savarese](https://www.linkedin.com/in/silvio-savarese-97b76114/) and [Caiming Xiong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caiming-xiong-150a1417/).

Previously, I completed my PhD at UC San Diego, working with [Julian McAuley](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=icbo4M0AAAAJ&hl=en). My research interests are in vision & language, with a current focus on building and understanding scalable vision-language models, e.g., multimodal LLMs and diffusion models.
